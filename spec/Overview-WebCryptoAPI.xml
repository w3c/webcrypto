      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This specification describes a JavaScript API for performing basic
        cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing,
        signature generation and verification, and encryption and decryption.
        Additionally, it describes an API for applications to generate and/or
        manage the keying material necessary to perform these operations. 
        Uses for this API range from user or service authentication, document
        or code signing, and the confidentiality and integrity of
        communications.

        <p>
          The Web Cryptography API defines a low-level interface to interacting with cryptographic
          key material that is managed or exposed by user agents. The API itself is agnostic of
          the underlying implementation of key storage, but provides a common set of interfaces
          that allow rich web applications to perform operations such as signature generation and
          verification, hashing and verification, encryption and decryption, without requiring
          access to the raw keying material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cryptographic transformations are exposed via the
          <a href="#dfn-SubtleCrypto">SubtleCrypto</a> interface, which defines a common set
          of methods and events for dealing with initialization, processing data, and completing
          the operation to yield the final output. In addition to operations such as signature
          generation and verification, hashing and verification, and encryption and decryption,
          the API provides interfaces for key generation, key derivation, key import and export,
          and key discovery.

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p class='norm'>This section is non-normative</p>
        <div id="multifactor-authentication" class="section">
          <h3>Multi-factor Authentication</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to extend or replace existing username/password based
            authentication schemes with authentication methods based on proving that the user has
            access to some secret keying material. Rather than using transport-layer authentication,
            such as TLS client certificates, the web application may wish to provide a rich user
            experience by providing authentication within the application itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, such an application could locate suitable client keys,
            which may have been previously generated via the user agent or pre-provisioned
            out-of-band by the web application. It could then perform cryptographic operations such
            as decrypting an authentication challenge followed by signing an authentication response.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, the authentication data could be further enhanced by binding the authentication
            to the TLS session that the client is authenticating over, by deriving a key based on
            properties of the underlying transport.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user did not already have a key associated with their account, the web application
            could direct the user agent to either generate a new key or to re-use an existing key of
            the user's choosing. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="protected-document" class="section">
          <h3>Protected Document Exchange</h3>
          <p>
            When exchanging documents that may contain sensitive or personal information, a
            web application may wish to ensure that only certain users can view the documents, even
            after they have been securely received, such as over TLS. One way that a web application
            can do so is by encrypting the documents with a secret key, and then wrapping that key
            with the public keys associated with authorized users.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a user agent navigates to such a web application, the application may send the
            encrypted form of the document. The user agent is then instructed to unwrap the encryption
            key, using the user's private key, and from there, decrypt and display the document.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="cloud-storage" class="section">
          <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
          <p>
            When storing data with remote service providers, users may wish to protect the
            confidentiality of their documents and data prior to uploading them. The Web
            Cryptography API allows an application to have a user select a private or secret key,
            to either derive encryption keys from the selected key or to directly encrypt documents
            using this key, and then to upload the transformed/encrypted data to the service provider
            using existing APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This use case is similar to the <a href="#protected-document">Protected Document
            Exchange</a> use case because Cloud Storage can be considered as a user exchanging
            protected data with himself in the future.

        <div id="document-signing" class="section">
          <h3>Document Signing</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to accept electronic signatures on documents, in lieu of
            requiring physical signatures. An authorized signature may use a key that was
            pre-provisioned out-of-band by the web application, or it may be using a key that the
            client generated specifically for the web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web application must be able to locate any appropriate keys for signatures, then
            direct the user to perform a signing operation over some data, as proof that they accept
            the document.

          <h3>Data Integrity Protection</h3>
          <p>
            When caching data locally, an application may wish to ensure that this data cannot be
            modified in an offline attack. In such a case, the server may sign the data that it
            intends the client to cache, with a private key held by the server. The web application
            that subsequently uses this cached data may contain a public key that enables it to
            validate that the cache contents have not been modified by anyone else.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="secure-messaging" class="section">
          <h3>Secure Messaging</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to a number of web applications already offering chat based services, the
            rise of WebSockets and RTCWEB allows a great degree of flexibility in inter-user-agent
            messaging. While TLS/DTLS may be used to protect messages to web applications, users
            may wish to directly secure messages using schemes such as off-the-record (OTR) messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Web Cryptography API enables OTR, by allowing key agreement to be performed so that
            the two parties can negotiate shared encryption keys and message authentication code (MAC)
            keys, to allow encryption and decryption of messages, and to prevent tampering of
            messages through the MACs.

          <p>
            The specification attempts to focus on the common functionality and features between
            various platform-specific or standardized cryptographic APIs, and avoid features and
            functionality that are specific to one or two implementations. As such this API allows
            key generation, management, and exchange with a level of abstraction that avoids
            developers needing to care about the implementation of the underlying key storage. The
            API is focused specifically around Key objects, as an abstraction for the underlying raw
            cryptographic keying material. The intent behind this is to allow an API that is generic
            enough to allow conforming user agents to expose keys that are stored and managed
            directly by the user agent, that may be stored or managed using isolated storage APIs
            such as per-user key stores provided by some operating systems, or within key storage
            devices such as secure elements, while allowing rich web applications to manipulate the
            keys and without requiring the web application be aware of the nature of the underlying
            key storage.

            as government or industry regulation, security best practices, intellectual property
            concerns, and constrained operational environments, this specification does not dictate
            a mandatory set of algorithms that <span class="RFC2119">MUST</span> be implemented.
            Instead, it defines a common set of bindings that can be used in an
            algorithm-independent manner, a common framework for discovering if a user agent or key
            handle supports the underlying algorithm, and a set of conformance requirements for the

            Although the API does not expose the notion of cryptographic providers or modules, each

            rest assured that the right cryptographic provider or module will be used to perform

            This API, while allowing applications to generate, retrieve, and manipulate keying
            material, does not specifically address the provisioning of keys in particular types of
            key storage, such as secure elements or smart cards. This is due to such provisioning
            operations often being burdened with vendor-specific details that make defining a
            vendor-agnostic interface an unsuitably unbounded task. Additionally, this API does not
            deal with or address the discovery of cryptographic modules, as such concepts are
            dependent upon the underlying user agent and are not concepts that are portable between
            common operating systems, cryptographic libraries, and implementations.

            User agents should take care before exposing keys that were not explicitly generated
            via the API in this specification or exposing keys that were generated in the
            context of other origins. Two applications with access to the same key handle may be
            able to spoof messages to each other, as both valid and hostile messages will appear
            to be valid for the given key. Because of this, user agents are recommended to obtain
            express permission from the user before re-using keys, unless there is a prearranged
            trust relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agents should be aware of the security considerations of each algorithm
            implemented and exposed to applications. For a number of algorithms, their
            cryptographic strength is relative to the amount of work necessary to compute the
            result, whether this be through the generation of significantly large prime numbers or
            through the repeatedly iterating through the same algorithm to reduce its
            susceptibility to brute force. Implementations should therefore take measures to
            ensure against misuse. Such measures may include requiring express user permission to
            compute some expensive operations, rate limiting the number of times the application
            may call certain APIs/algorithms, and defining implementation-specific upper limits
            for inputs such as key sizes or iteration counts, as appropriate for the device on
            which the implementation executes.

          <p>
            In some cases, the same underlying cryptographic key material may be re-usable for
            multiple algorithms. One such example is an RSA key, which may be used for both
            signing and encryption, or with RSA-PKCS1v1.5 and RSA-PSS. In some cases, the re-use
            of this key material may undermine the security properties of the key and allow
            applications to recover the raw material.

                One proposed technical solution for user agents is to implement "key tainting", in
                which it records how a particular key has been used (eg: algorithms, parameters),
                and prevents it from being re-used in a manner that is unsafe or contrary to the
                security - such as preventing a PKCS1-v1.5 key from being used with RSA-PSS, or
                preventing an RSA-OAEP w/ MGF1-SHA1 from being used with RSA-OAEP w/ MGF1-SHA256.
                Questions exist about whether this should be encouraged or permitted, and the
                interoperability concerns it might cause.

            While this API provides important functionality for the development of secure
            applications, it does not attempt to provide a mitigation for existing threats to
            the web security model, such as script injection or hostile intermediaries. As such,
            application developers must take care to ensure applications are secured against
            common and traditional attacks, such as script injection, by making use of appropriate
            existing functionality such as Content Security Policy and the use of TLS.
          </p>
          <p>
            This API includes a variety of cryptographic operations, some of which may have known
            security issues when used inappropriately. Application developers should take care to
            review the appropriate cryptographic literature before making use of certain algorithms,
            and should avoid attempting to develop new cryptographic protocols whenever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the API in this specification provides a means to protect keys from future access
            by web applications, it makes no statements as to how the actual keying material will be
            stored by an implementation. As such, although a key may be inaccessible to web content,
            it should not be presumed that it is inaccessible to end-users. For example, a
            conforming user agent may choose to implement key storage by storing key material in
            plain text on device storage. Although the user agent prevents access to the raw keying
            material to web applications, any user with access to device storage may be able to
            recover the key.

            Malicious applications may be able to fingerprint users or user agents by detecting or
            enumerating the list of algorithms that are supported. This is especially true if an
            implementation exposes details about users' smart cards or secure element storage, as
            the combination of algorithms supported by such devices may be used to fingerprint
            devices more accurately than just the particular user agent.

          <dt>Tracking</dt>
          <dd>
            If user agents permit keys to be re-used between origins, without performing any
            secondary operations such as key derivation that includes the origin, then it may be
            possible for two origins to collude and track a unique user by recording their ability
            to access a common key.

          <dd>
            With the exception of ephemeral keys, its often desirable for applications to strongly
            associate users with keys. These associations may be used to enhance the security of
            authenticating to the application, such as using a key stored in a secure element as a
            second factor, or may be used by users to assert some identity, such as an e-mail
            signing identity. As such, these keys often live longer than their counterparts such as
            usernames and passwords, and it may be undesirable or prohibitive for users to revoke
            these keys.
            Because of this, keys may exist longer than the lifetime of the browsing context
            [<a href="#HTML">HTML</a>] and beyond the lifetime of items such as cookies, thus
            presenting a risk that a user may be tracked even after clearing such data. This is
            especially true for keys that were pre-provisioned for particular origins and for which
            no user interaction was provided.

          <p>
            This specification provides a uniform interface for many different kinds of keying
            material managed by the user agent. This may include keys that have been generated by
            the user agent, derived from other keys by the user agent, imported to the user agent
            through user actions or using this API, pre-provisioned within software or hardware to
            which the user agent has access or made available to the user agent in other ways. The
            term key refers broadly to any keying material including actual keys for cryptographic
            operations and secret values obtained within key derivation or exchange operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Key object is not required to directly interface with the underlying key storage
            mechanism, and may instead simply be a reference for the user agent to understand how to
            obtain the keying material when needed, eg. when performing a cryptographic operation.

          <p>
            The <a href="#dfn-SubtleCrypto">SubtleCrypto</a> interface provides a set of
            methods for dealing with low-level cryptographic primitives and algorithms. It is
            named <code>SubtleCrypto</code> to reflect the fact that many of these algorithms
            have subtle usage requirements in order to provide the required algorithmic
            security guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the direct use of an unauthenticated encryption scheme, such as
            <a href="#aes-ctr">AES in counter mode</a>, gives potential attackers the ability to
            manipulate bits in the output by manipulating bits in the input, compromising the
            integrity of the message. However, AES-CTR can be used securely in combination
            with other cryptographic primitives, such as message authentication codes, to ensure
            the integrity of the protected message, but only when the message authentication
            code is constructed over the encrypted message and IV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers making use of the SubtleCrypto interface are expected to be aware of the
            security concerns associated with both the design and implementation of the various
            algorithms provided. The raw algorithms are provided in order to allow developers
            maximum flexibility in implementing a variety of protocols and applications, each of
            which may represent the composition and security parameters in a unique manner that
            necessitate the use of the raw algorithms.

                    The key wrapping operations for some algorithms place constraints on the payload
                    size. For example AES-KW requires the payload to be a multiple of 8 bytes in
                    length and RSA-OAEP places a restriction on the length. For key formats that
                    offer flexibility in serialization of a given key (for example JWK),
                    implementations may choose to adapt the serialization to the constraints of
                    the wrapping algorithm.

          is NOT a sign bit. Implementors should take care when mapping to big integer
          implementations that expected signed integers.

            As the API is meant to be extensible in order to keep up with future developments within
            cryptography and to provide flexibility, there are no strictly required algorithms. Thus
            users of this API should check to see what algorithms are currently recommended and
            supported by implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in order to promote interoperability for developers, there are a number of
            recommended algorithms. The recommended algorithms are:

              OPEN ISSUE: The import/export of JWK ignores the "alg" field, because it does not

              because it is safe to do so) and the JWS alg (which incorporates the hash algorithm).

              The <code>"AES-CBC"</code> algorithm identifier is used to perform
              encryption and decryption using AES in Cipher Block Chaining mode,
              as described in NIST SP 800-38A [<a href="#SP800-38A">SP800-38A</a>].
            </p>
            <p>
              When operating in CBC mode, messages that are not exact multiples
              of the AES block size (16 bytes) can be padded under a variety of
              padding schemes. In the Web Crypto API, the only padding mode that
              is supported is that of PKCS#7, as described by
              Section 10.3, step 2, of RFC 2315 [<a href="#RFC2315">RFC2315</a>].

                The definition of HKDF allows the caller to supply an optional pseudorandom salt
                value, which is used as the key during the extract phase. If this value is not
                supplied, an all zero string is used instead. However, support for an explicit
                salt value is not widely implemented in existing APIs, nor is it required by
                existing usages of HKDF. Should this be an optional parameter, and if so, what
                should the behaviour be of a user agent that does not support explicit salt
                values (is it conforming or non-conforming?)

            The handling of "id-RSASSA-PSS" and "id-RSAES-OAEP" are tricky.
            <a href="#RFC5756">RFC 5756</a> recommends implementations should not include parameters
            when PSS is used with a subjectPublicKeyInfo, and MUST NOT include parameters when OAEP
            is used. However, when OAEP is used as part of a key transport (as an AlgorithmIdentifier),
            implementations MUST include the parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The natural conflict is in deciding when a key is being exported as part of a
            subjectPublicKeyInfo (which is what "spki" implies) and when it's being used as an
            algorithmIdentifier for transport.
