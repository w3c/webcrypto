      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This specification describes a JavaScript API for performing basic
        cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing,
        signature generation and verification, and encryption and decryption.
        Additionally, it describes an API for applications to generate and/or
        manage the keying material necessary to perform these operations.
        Uses for this API range from user or service authentication, document
        or code signing, and the confidentiality and integrity of
        communications.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Web Cryptography API defines a low-level interface to interacting with cryptographic
          key material that is managed or exposed by user agents. The API itself is agnostic of
          the underlying implementation of key storage, but provides a common set of interfaces
          that allow rich web applications to perform operations such as signature generation and
          verification, hashing and verification, encryption and decryption, without requiring
          access to the raw keying material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cryptographic transformations are exposed via the
          {{SubtleCrypto}} interface, which defines a set of methods
          for performing common cryptographic operations. In addition to operations such as signature
          generation and verification, hashing and verification, and encryption and decryption,
          the API provides interfaces for key generation, key derivation and key import and export.

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <section id="multifactor-authentication">
          <h3>Multi-factor Authentication</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to extend or replace existing username/password based
            authentication schemes with authentication methods based on proving that the user has
            access to some secret keying material. Rather than using transport-layer authentication,
            such as TLS client certificates, the web application may prefer the richer user
            experience provided by authenticating within the application itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application could locate suitable client keys, which
            may have been previously generated via the user agent or pre-provisioned out-of-band by
            the web application. It could then perform cryptographic operations such as decrypting an
            authentication challenge followed by signing an authentication response.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exchange could be further strengthened by binding the authentication to the TLS
            session over which the client is authenticating, by deriving a key based on properties of
            the underlying transport.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user does not already have a key associated with their account, the web application
            could direct the user agent to either generate a new key or to re-use an existing key of
            the user's choice.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="protected-document">
          <h3>Protected Document Exchange</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to limit the viewership of documents that contain sensitive or
            personal information, even when these documents have been securely received, such as over
            TLS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application could do so by encrypting the documents
            with a secret key, and then wrapping that key with the public keys associated with the
            authorized viewers. When a user agent navigates to such a web application, the
            application would send the encrypted form of the document. The user agent is then
            instructed to unwrap the encryption key, using the user's private key, and from there,
            decrypt and display the document.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="cloud-storage">
          <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to permit users to protect the confidentiality of data and
            documents stored with remote service providers prior to uploading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application may have a user select a private or
            secret key, optionally derive an encryption key from the selected key, encrypt the
            document, and then upload the encrypted data to the service provider using existing APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This use case is similar to the <a href="#protected-document">Protected Document
            Exchange</a> use case, with viewership of the document limited to the user themself.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="document-signing">
          <h3>Document Signing</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to accept electronic signatures on documents, in lieu of
            requiring physical signatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application may direct the user to select a key,
            which may have been pre-provisioned out-of-band, or generated specifically for the web
            application. Using this key, the application may perform a signing operation over some
            data, as proof that the user accepts the document.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="data-integrity-protection">
          <h3>Data Integrity Protection</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to cache data locally, while ensuring that this data cannot be
            modified in an offline attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application may use a public key contained within the
            application to verify the contents of the data cache. Previously, when data was added to
            the cache, it would have been signed by the server with the corresponding private key. By
            validating the signature when restoring data from the cache, the client ensures that the
            cached data has not been tampered with.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="secure-messaging">
          <h3>Secure Messaging</h3>
          <p>
            A web application may wish to employ message layer security using schemes such as
            off-the-record (OTR) messaging, even when these messages have been securely received,
            such as over TLS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Web Cryptography API enables OTR and similar message signing schemes, by allowing key
            agreement to be performed. The two parties can negotiate shared encryption keys and
            message authentication code (MAC) keys, to allow encryption and decryption of messages,
            and to prevent tampering.

            A web application may wish to interact with the structures and message formats defined by
            the IETF JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Web Cryptography API, the application may read and import keys encoded in the
            JSON key format (JWK), validate messages that have been integrity protected using digital
            signatures or MACs (JWS), or decrypt messages that have been encrypted (JWE).

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
          The following conformance classes are defined by this specification:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn id="dfn-conforming-implementation">conforming user agent</dfn></dt>
          <dd>

              A user agent is considered to be a

              if it satisfies all of the MUST-,
              REQUIRED- and SHALL-level
              criteria in this specification that apply to implementations. This specification
              uses both the terms "conforming user agent" and "user agent" to refer to this
              product class.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
          manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in
          this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification
          MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
          ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WebIDL]]
          as this specification uses that specification and terminology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a
          [= case-sensitive =] manner. String literals in this specification
           written in monospace font like <code>"this"</code> do not include the enclosing quotes.

        <section id="extensibility">
          <h3>Extensibility</h3>
          <p>
            Vendor-specific proprietary extensions to this specification are strongly discouraged.
            Authors must not use such extensions, as doing so reduces interoperability and fragments
            the user base, allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in
            question.
          </p>
          <p>
            If vendor-specific extensions are needed, the members should be prefixed by
            vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future versions of this specification.
            Extensions must be defined so that the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes
            the non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed, either this
            specification can be updated accordingly, or an extension specification can be written
            that overrides the requirements in this specification. When someone applying this
            specification to their activities decides that they will recognize the requirements of
            such an extension specification, it becomes an

          <h3>Level of abstraction</h3>
          <p>
            The specification attempts to focus on the common functionality and features between
            various platform-specific or standardized cryptographic APIs, and avoid features and
            functionality that are specific to one or two implementations. As such this API allows
            key generation, management, and exchange with a level of abstraction that avoids
            developers needing to care about the implementation of the underlying key storage. The
            API is focused specifically around CryptoKey objects, as an abstraction for the
            underlying raw cryptographic keying material. The intent behind this is to allow an API
            that is generic enough to allow conforming user agents to expose keys that are stored
            and managed directly by the user agent, that may be stored or managed using isolated
            storage APIs such as per-user key stores provided by some operating systems, or within
            key storage devices such as secure elements, while allowing rich web applications to
            manipulate the keys and without requiring the web application be aware of the nature of
            the underlying key storage.

            Because the underlying cryptographic implementations will vary between conforming user

            as government or industry regulation, security best practices, intellectual property
            concerns, and constrained operational environments, this specification does not dictate
            a mandatory set of algorithms that MUST be implemented.
            Instead, it defines a common set of bindings that can be used in an
            algorithm-independent manner, a common framework for discovering if a user agent or key
            handle supports the underlying algorithm, and a set of conformance requirements for the

            This API, while allowing applications to generate, retrieve, and manipulate keying
            material, does not specifically address the provisioning of keys in particular types of
            key storage, such as secure elements or smart cards. This is due to such provisioning
            operations often being burdened with vendor-specific details that make defining a
            vendor-agnostic interface an unsuitably unbounded task. Additionally, this API does not
            deal with or address the discovery of cryptographic modules, as such concepts are
            dependent upon the underlying user agent and are not concepts that are portable between
            common operating systems, cryptographic libraries, and implementations.

          <h3>Underlying Cryptographic Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            This specification assumes, but does not require, that conforming user agents do not
            and will not be directly implementing cryptographic operations within the user agent
            itself. Historically, many user agents have deferred cryptographic operations, such as
            those used within TLS, to existing APIs that are available as part of the underlying
            operating system or to third-party modules that are managed independently of the user
            agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The {{CryptoKey}} object represents the bridge between the
            JavaScript execution environment and these underlying libraries, through the use of the
            internal slot named {{CryptoKey/[[handle]]}}. The handle
            represents an opaque type that is implementation specific, which may not be represented
            within a JavaScript type, nor is it ever exposed to script authors. In this way, the
            {{CryptoKey}} object is the conceptual equivalent to the
            JavaScript executing environment as the
            {{CryptoKey/[[handle]]}} is to the underlying cryptographic
            implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            These APIs are traditionally built around a notion of cryptographic providers, an
            abstraction for a specific implementation of a set of algorithms. The operating system
            or library may come with a default provider, and users are frequently allowed to add
            additional providers, reconfigure the set of enabled algorithms, or otherwise customize
            how cryptographic services are provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it is assumed that most user agents will be interacting with a cryptographic
            provider that is implemented purely in software, it is not required by this
            specification. As a result, the capabilities of some implementations may be limited by
            the capabilities of the underlying hardware, and, depending on how the user has
            configured the underlying cryptographic library, this may be entirely opaque to the
            User Agent.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="concepts-key-storage">
          <h3>Key Storage</h3>
          <p>
            This specification does not explicitly provide any new storage mechanisms for
            {{CryptoKey}} objects. Instead, by defining
            <a href="#cryptokey-interface-serializable">serialization and deserialization steps</a>
            for {{CryptoKey}} objects, any existing or future web storage mechanisms that support
            storing <a>serializable objects</a> can be used to store {{CryptoKey}} objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, it is expected that most authors will make use of the
            Indexed Database API [[INDEXEDDB]], which allows associative storage of
            key/value pairs, where the key is some string identifier meaningful to the application,
            and the value is a {{CryptoKey}} object. This allows the
            storage and retrieval of key material, without ever exposing that key material to the
            application or the JavaScript environment. Additionally, this allows authors
            the full flexibility to store any additional metadata with the

          <p>
            By not providing an explicit storage mechanism, this specification assumes that
            {{CryptoKey}} objects are scoped to the current execution
            environment and any storage mechanisms available to that environment (e.g.
            Indexed Database API). Application authors rely upon this for
            the security of their applications; two origins with the same
            {{CryptoKey}} object have full access to the underlying key,
            and as such, messages from these applications cannot be distinguished, and messages sent
            to these applications can be fully recovered. Implementors should ensure that no
            {{CryptoKey}} objects are shared between two origins unless
            the author has explicitly chosen to share (e.g., such as through the use of postMessage)
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of algorithms specified within this specification perform computationally
            intensive work, such as the generation of significantly large prime numbers, or through
            repeated iterations of a particular operation. As such, hostile applications may attempt
            to misuse this API and attempt to cause significant amount of work to be performed by
            an implementation, denying access or services to other applications that are executing.
            Implementations should take steps to mitigate these risks, such as limiting the amount
            of operations an implementation performs concurrently, requiring user consent for
            operations that may be known to be disruptive for the executing environment, or defining
            device-specific limits on attributes such as key sizes or iteration counts.

          <h2>Security considerations for authors</h2>
          <p>
            This specification includes descriptions for a variety of cryptographic operations, some
            of which have known weaknesses when used inappropriately. Application developers must
            take care and review appropriate and current cryptographic literature, to understand and
            mitigate such issues. In general, application developers are <strong>strongly</strong>
            discouraged from inventing new cryptographic protocols; as with all applications, users
            of this specification will be best served through the use of existing protocols, of
            which this specification provides the necessary building blocks to implement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to use the APIs defined in this specification to provide any meaningful
            cryptographic assurances, authors must be familiar with existing threats to web
            applications, as well as the underlying security model employed. Conceptually, issues
            such as script injection are the equivalent to remote code execution in other operating
            environments, and allowing hostile script to be injected may allow for the exfiltration
            of keys or data. Script injection may come from other applications, for which the
            judicious use of Content Security Policy may mitigate, or it may come from hostile
            network intermediaries, for which the use of Transport Layer Security may mitigate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This specification does not define any specific mechanisms for the storage of
            cryptographic keys. By default, unless specific effort is taken by the author to persist
            keys, such as through the use of the Indexed Database API, keys
            created with this API will only be valid for the duration of the current page (e.g.
            until a navigation event). Authors that wish to use the same key across different pages
            or multiple browsing sessions must employ existing web storage technologies. Authors
            should be aware of the security assumptions of these technologies, such as the
            same-origin security model; that is, any application that shares the same scheme, host,
            and port have access to the same storage partition, even if other information, such as
            the path, may differ. Authors may explicitly choose to relax this security through the
            use of inter-origin sharing, such as <code>postMessage</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors should be aware that this specification places no normative requirements on
            implementations as to how the underlying cryptographic key material is stored. The only
            requirement is that key material is not exposed to script, except through the use of the
            {{SubtleCrypto/exportKey}} and {{SubtleCrypto/wrapKey}} operations. In particular, it does
            not guarantee that the underlying cryptographic key material will not be persisted to
            disk, possibly unencrypted, nor that it will be inaccessible to users or other
            applications running with the same privileges as the User Agent. Any application or user
            that has access to the device storage may be able to recover the key material, even
            through scripts may be prohibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            This specification places no normative requirements on how implementations handle key
            material once all references to it go away. That is, conforming user agents are not
            required to zeroize key material, and it may still be accessible on device storage or
            device memory, even after all references to the {{CryptoKey}}
            have gone away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications may share a {{CryptoKey}} object across security
            boundaries, such as origins, through the use of the structured clone algorithm and APIs
            such as <code>postMessage</code>. While access to the underlying cryptographic key
            material may be restricted, based upon the {{CryptoKey/extractable}}
            attribute, once a key is shared with a destination origin, the source origin can not
            later restrict or revoke access to the key. As such, authors must be careful to ensure
            they trust the destination origin to take the same mitigations against hostile script
            that the source origin employs. Further, in the event of script injection on the source
            origin, attackers may post the key to an origin under attacker control. Any time that
            the user agent visits the attacker's origin, the user agent may be directed to perform
            cryptographic operations using that key, such as the decryption of existing messages
            or the creation of new, fraudulent messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors should be aware that users may, at any time, choose to clear the storage
            associated with an origin, potentially destroying keys. Applications that are meant to
            provide long-term storage, such as on the server, should consider techniques such as
            key escrow to prevent such data from being inaccessible. Authors should not presume
            that keys will be available indefinitely.

            Users of applications that employ the APIs defined in this specification should be aware

            use these APIs will have full access to the decrypted message as well.

            By exposing additional APIs that reflect capabilities of the underlying platform, this

            This specification does not provide any means for malicious applications to create
            identifiers that outlive existing web storage technologies. However, care must be taken
            when introducing future revisions to this API or additional cryptographic capabilities,
            such as those that are hardware backed (e.g.: smart cards or Trusted Platform Modules).
            Considering that such storage is designed to prevent any two users from having the same
            underlying key data, such APIs may represent a real risk of being used as a permanent
            identifier against the user's wishes.

          Implementations should generate cryptographically strong random values using
          well-established cryptographic pseudo-random number generators seeded with high-quality
          entropy, such as from an operating-system entropy source (e.g., "/dev/urandom"). This
          specification provides no lower-bound on the information theoretic entropy present in
          cryptographically strong random values, but implementations should make a best effort to provide
          as much entropy as practicable.
        </div>
        <div class=note>
          This interface defines a synchronous method for obtaining cryptographically strong random
          values. While some devices and implementations may support truly random cryptographic
          number generators or provide interfaces that block when there is insufficient entropy,
          implementations are discouraged from using these sources when implementing
          getRandomValues, both for performance and to avoid depleting the system of entropy.
          Instead, these sources should be used to seed a cryptographic pseudo-random number
          generator that can then return suitable values efficiently.

            The {{SubtleCrypto}} interface is named "SubtleCrypto" to reflect the fact that many
            of these algorithms have subtle usage requirements in order to provide the required
            algorithmic security guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the direct use of an unauthenticated encryption scheme, such as
            <a href="#aes-ctr">AES in counter mode</a>, gives potential attackers the ability to
            manipulate bits in the output by manipulating bits in the input, compromising the
            integrity of the message. However, AES-CTR can be used securely in combination
            with other cryptographic primitives, such as message authentication codes, to ensure
            the integrity of the protected message, but only when the message authentication
            code is constructed over the encrypted message and IV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers making use of the SubtleCrypto interface are expected to be aware of the
            security concerns associated with both the design and implementation of the various
            algorithms provided. The raw algorithms are provided in order to allow developers
            maximum flexibility in implementing a variety of protocols and applications, each of
            which may represent the composition and security parameters in a unique manner that
            necessitate the use of the raw algorithms.

                    Because the wrapKey method effectively exports the key, only keys marked as extractable
                    may be wrapped. In particular, this means that this API cannot create a wrapped JWK key
                    that is marked as non-extractable using the {{JsonWebKey/ext}} JWK member.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the unwrapKey method <em>does</em> support the JsonWebKey/ext}} JWK member,
                    so that wrapped non-extractable keys created elsewhere, for example by a server, can be
                    unwrapped using this API.

                  <p>
                    The key wrapping operations for some algorithms place constraints on the payload
                    size. For example AES-KW requires the payload to be a multiple of 8 bytes in
                    length and RSA-OAEP places a restriction on the length. For key formats that
                    offer flexibility in serialization of a given key (for example JWK),
                    implementations may choose to adapt the serialization to the constraints of
                    the wrapping algorithm. This is why JSON.stringify is not normatively required,
                    as otherwise it would prohibit implementations from introducing added
                    padding.

              <p>
              The {{AlgorithmIdentifier}} typedef permits
              algorithms to either be specified as a {{DOMString}} or an
              object. The usage of {{DOMString}} is to permit authors a
              short-hand for noting algorithms that have no parameters (e.g. SHA-1).
              The usage of object is to allow an {{Algorithm}} (or appropriate subclass) to be specified, which
              contains all of the associated parameters for an object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of this, it's necessary to define the algorithm for converting an {{AlgorithmIdentifier}} into an appropriate dictionary
              that is usable with this API. This algorithm must be extensible, so as to allow new
              cryptographic algorithms to be added, and consistent, so that Web IDL type mapping can
              occur before any control is returned to the calling script, which would potentially
              allow the mutation of parameters or the script environment.

            <h4>For Authors</h4>
            <p>
              As this API is meant to be extensible, in order to keep up with future developments
              within cryptography, there are no algorithms that conforming user agents are required
              to implement. As such, authors should check to see what algorithms are currently
              recommended and supported by implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
              As highlighted in the <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>,
              even cryptographic algorithms that might be considered strong for one purpose may be
              insufficient when used with another purpose. Authors should therefore proceed with
              extreme caution before inventing new cryptographic protocols.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, this specification includes several algorithms which, in their default
              usage, can result in cryptographic vulnerabilities. While these concerns may be
              mitigated, such as through the combination and composition with additional algorithms
              provided by this specification, authors should proceed with caution and review the
              relevant cryptographic literature before using a given algorithm. The inclusion of
              algorithms within this specification is not an indicator of their suitability for any
              or all purpose, and instead merely serve to provide as a specification for how a
              conforming User Agent must implement the given algorithm, if it choses to implement
              the algorithm.

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            The <code>"AES-CBC"</code> algorithm identifier is used to perform
            encryption and decryption using AES in Cipher Block Chaining mode,
            as described in [[NIST-SP800-38A]].
          </p>
          <p>
            When operating in CBC mode, messages that are not exact multiples
            of the AES block size (16 bytes) can be padded under a variety of
            padding schemes. In the Web Crypto API, the only padding mode that
            is supported is that of PKCS#7, as described by
            Section 10.3, step 2, of [[RFC2315]].

            For "id-RSASSA-PSS" and "id-RSAES-OAEP",
            [[RFC5756]] recommends implementations should not include parameters
            when PSS is used with a <code>subjectPublicKeyInfo</code>, and MUST NOT include parameters when OAEP
            is used. However, when OAEP is used as part of a key transport (as an <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code>),
            implementations MUST include the parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The {{KeyFormat/"spki"}} key format in this specification implies
            <code>subjectPublicKeyInfo</code> and thus may not be appropriate when what is needed is an
            <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code> for transport.
